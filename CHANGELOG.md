# Changelog

## [jackal-plan-and-execute] 3.4.0

Flat orchestration topology by default; justification-gated middle tier (#19, R3).

**New:**
- `execute` skill gains an `## Orchestration Topology` section: flat (director → workers) is the
  default, with the GL-488 per-phase warm-context `SendMessage` named-continuation pattern named as
  the reference implementation.
- A middle supervisor tier now requires a one-sentence written justification in the Agent dispatch
  prompt (what the tier provides that flat dispatch + memory cannot); a nested-supervisor dispatch
  without it is declared a defect.
- When a middle tier is used, R2's liveness contract applies with a stricter (shorter) `EXPECT`
  window — cross-referenced, not duplicated.
- Explicit reconciliation with the repo CLAUDE.md sole-orchestrator rule, written into the skill
  text: flat-by-default + the narrow, justification-gated nested-supervisor tier as the documented
  exception (CLAUDE.md itself unchanged).

## [jackal-supervisor] 3.3.0

Sweeps run flat, not under a nested Opus supervisor (#19, R3).

**New:**
- `jackal-sweep` skill directs backlog sweeps to run as direct director work or at most a single
  Sonnet research dispatch — never a nested Opus supervisor — unless justified per the `execute`
  skill's Orchestration Topology policy (one-sentence justification + stricter liveness window).

## [jackal-plan-and-execute] 3.3.0

Enforce explicit model tiering + credential pre-flight + commit-early discipline (#22, R4+R5).

**New:**
- Every `<invoke name="Agent">` dispatch in the execute, plan, review, design, and finish skills now carries an explicit `<parameter name="model">`; a model-unspecified dispatch is declared a defect.
- Model Tier Table (planner=Opus, implementor=Sonnet, reviewer=Sonnet, reviewer-deep=Opus, contract-sentinel=Sonnet, lexicon-warden=Sonnet, doc-render/research=Sonnet) in the execute skill, with a footnote reconciling the sentinel/warden `model: haiku` frontmatter (dispatch sites live in jackal-director — deferred follow-up).
- Credential pre-flight (`aws sts get-caller-identity` + remaining-lifetime check) before any dispatch expected to run >10 min — framed as generic guidance for downstream projects, not a gate on this repo.
- Commit-early clause in the implementor prompt: commit at every green intermediate state so credential expiry or a stall can't destroy uncommitted work.

## [jackal-supervisor] 3.2.0

Model tiering + credential pre-flight (#22, R4+R5).

**New:**
- Model Tiers section mirroring the execute skill's tier table; every supervisor dispatch specifies `model` explicitly.
- Credential pre-flight guidance before long-running dispatches (downstream-project scope).

## [jackal-supervisor] 3.1.1

Promote operational lessons from director memory into shared skill/agent text (#21).

**New:**
- Merged-PR gate: `jackal-supervisor.md` "Reading the backlog" and Backlog Groom now cross-check every candidate OPEN issue against merged PRs before ranking, routing delivered-but-open issues to a separate "stale-open — close these" list (prevents the GL-347 mis-ranking). The gate treats `gh issue view --json closedByPullRequestsReferences` as the exact delivery signal and `gh pr list --search` as a candidate filter only — a raw search hit is confirmed as delivery only after reading the matched PR's title/body for an explicit `Closes`/`Fixes`/`Refs #<N>` on the exact issue number. `jackal-sweep` report surfaces the stale-open list and points to the gate.
- Rule of thumb: memory is for project facts/preferences; any lesson that changes agent procedure goes into the owning skill/agent definition the same session, memory cross-references it, and stale entries are superseded.

## [jackal-plan-and-execute] 3.2.1

Promote operational lessons into shared skill/agent text (#21).

**New:**
- `execute` skill Step 4 (backlog select): merged-PR gate drops candidates already delivered by a merged PR before priority ordering, using `closedByPullRequestsReferences` as the exact signal and a `gh pr list --search` hit only as a candidate needing PR-body confirmation (not delivery proof by itself).
- `implementor.md` Verify step: run `ruff format`/`ruff check --fix` before committing when the project uses Ruff (conditional; no-op for non-ruff repos).

## [jackal-plan-and-execute] 3.2.0

Event-driven waits + subagent liveness contract (#18).

**New:**
- `execute` skill documents the event-driven watcher (`scripts/worktree-watcher.sh`), the
  sleep<timeout hard rule (foreground sleeps ≤100s under the 120s Bash timeout), the batched-status
  rule, and the STALLED stall-response procedure (verify disk → instruct commit-and-report → resume
  from disk).
- Honest-stopping-point clause added to `implementor.md` and both `execute` dispatch templates;
  EXPECT/heartbeat expectation set at dispatch; relay rule forbidding unbacked progress claims,
  cross-referencing `verification-before-completion`.

## [jackal-supervisor] 3.1.0

Subagent liveness contract (#18).

**New:**
- Honest-stopping-point clause added to `jackal-supervisor.md` alongside the "workers never spawn
  workers" rule (belt-and-braces prompt-level enforcement). Supervisor retains the `Agent` tool as
  the sole orchestrator.

## [jackal-director] 1.4.0

Event-driven waits + liveness, director-side (#18).

**New:**
- `director-loop` skill mirrors the event-driven wait / STALLED stall-response summary and the
  relay rule (no relayed subagent progress claim without a cited same-turn disk observation),
  referencing the `execute` skill for the canonical procedure.

## [jackal-director] 1.3.0

Director operating-discipline notes for autonomous cycles.

**Changed:**
- `director-loop` skill: added an "Operating discipline (autonomous cycles)" section covering a preventive metadata-commit routing note (adopt a PR/exception route before enforce_admins-style tightening; preserves the PR-only completion invariant — no observed violation) and a `/clear` context-growth discipline note for issue/PR boundaries.

## [jackal-director] 1.2.0

Monorepo support: contracts no longer have to live in one central package. Driven by the ROAR
governance comparison (per-module contracts, existing `docs/standards/` + import-linter layer).

**New:**
- Per-component contract sources: the registry's Component Map may carry `Contract source` and
  `Exporter` columns; `registry-drift-checker`, `contract-sentinel`, and `delta-scribe` resolve
  contract paths from those rows when present, falling back to the single contracts package
  header (which keeps working unchanged).
- Registry-as-index sections: a contract section with a `Source:` line and no fields table
  delegates field-level truth to the referenced model file; the drift checker audits the
  reference (path exists, model defined there) instead of mirroring fields.
- `Boundary enforcement:` registry header line for repos that already machine-enforce
  boundaries (import-linter, ESLint boundary rules); `canon-init` detects such tooling and
  `contract-check` reports C3 as a second witness — drift between sentinel and linter is a
  director-packet item.

**Changed:**
- `canon-init` now documents "one canon per repo, even in a monorepo" (per-module canons are an
  anti-pattern; the per-component registry is the monorepo affordance), seeds the glossary from
  curated docs (`docs/standards/`, CLAUDE.md Contracts/Invariants sections) before falling back
  to a frequency grep, layers on top of existing standards docs instead of duplicating them, and
  drops `.gitkeep` files into `reports/` and `packets/` so the scaffolded tree survives a fresh
  clone.
- `director-loop` skill and README describe both registry modes and the one-canon rule.

## [jackal-plan-and-execute] 3.1.1

Wording sync with jackal-director 1.2.0's per-component contract sources.

**Changed:**
- `design`, `execute`, and `review` skills and `reviewer-deep` now say "contract sources" (the
  contracts package or per-component contract files named in `docs/canon/registry.md`) wherever
  they previously assumed a single contracts package for impact statements and review-tier
  routing.

## [jackal-supervisor] 3.0.3

Graceful complexity-routing fallback instead of telling the user to re-run a different command.

**Changed:**
- `jackal-design-plan` on a Standard issue now auto-invokes `jackal-impl-plan` instead of
  telling the user to run it themselves; on a Simple issue it now dispatches the implementor
  directly instead of telling the user to.
- `jackal-impl-plan` on a Simple issue now dispatches the implementor directly instead of
  telling the user to.

## [jackal-director] 1.1.1

Closes a no-nesting guard gap on the Haiku conformance agents.

**Fixed:**
- `delta-scribe`, `contract-sentinel`, `lexicon-warden`, and `registry-drift-checker` now carry
  `disallowedTools: Agent` in frontmatter and an explicit "never dispatch or invoke other
  subagents" rule in their body, matching the pattern already used by `director`. Their dispatch
  prompt templates in `director-packet` and `contract-check` now repeat the prohibition in the
  prompt text as well.

## [jackal-plan-and-execute] 3.1.0

Execution efficiency and review calibration for the plan/backlog loops (design plan C3–C6).

**New:**
- The Mode 1 phase loop dispatches the implementor as a named agent on phase 1 and continues it
  via SendMessage for phases 2..N, reusing warm (cache-hot) context. Falls back to a fresh
  dispatch when continuation fails, a review cycle found Critical issues, or
  `implementor_continuation: off` is set in `.jackal/harness-guidance.md`. Continuation is
  per-issue; parallel issues keep separate named agents; the reviewer is never continued.
- Simple issues in backlog mode now run one Sonnet `reviewer` pass by default (implementor →
  reviewer → finish), feeding the existing 3-cycle fix loop. Overridable with
  `simple_review: off`.
- The orchestrator may read a single explicitly-named file in full for routing/triage
  classification — a scoped exception to the no-direct-read delegation rule that does not cover
  multi-file or search-driven reads.

**Changed:**
- `implementor.md` acknowledges follow-up phases may arrive in the same session and treats each
  phase file as the complete spec for that phase.

**Fixed:**
- `reviewer` / `reviewer-deep` report caps now govern prose only — a Critical or Important
  finding can never be dropped to hit the length target; Minor findings may compress.

## [jackal-director] 1.1.0

Adds an automated fallback for the Director review loop so it can run without a Fable or
other strong-model chat session available.

**New:**
- The automated `/jackal-director:director-review` command and the read-only Opus `director`
  agent (tools: Read only; no repo access by design) — an automated fallback for the Director
  loop when no Fable or other strong-model chat is available; ingestion stays human-gated.

**Changed:**
- The Director is now described in capability-relative terms (a fresh-context reviewer with
  no repo access, run on the strongest model available) across director-loop, director-packet,
  ingest-directive, and the plugin README; Fable named only as the preferred option. Cadence
  section gains the fallback ladder.

## [marketplace] — remove redundant wrapper commands

Each `jackal-supervisor` / `jackal-plan-and-execute` entry point shipped
**twice** — as a thin wrapper command *and* as a same-named `user-invocable`
skill. The two collide (the skill wins the name), so the wrapper never ran; but
its body ("invoke the X skill", a bare, self-referential name) is what produced
the "thin wrapper, then searching for the skill" behavior on invocation. Plugin
bumps: `jackal-plan-and-execute` 3.0.2 → 3.0.3, `jackal-supervisor` 3.0.1 → 3.0.2.

**Removed:**
- The 10 redundant wrapper command files in `jackal-supervisor` and
  `jackal-plan-and-execute`. Their same-named `user-invocable` skills already
  provide the identical `/plugin:name` entry point, so the wrappers were dead
  (shadowed by the skill). Each command's `argument-hint` was ported into the
  corresponding skill's frontmatter, so the `/`-menu hint is preserved.
  (`jackal-director` commands stay — they are self-contained, with no
  same-named skill.)

## [marketplace] — namespace command handoffs

Fixes end-of-phase handoffs and workflow docs that emitted bare slash commands
(`/execute`, `/jackal-impl-plan`, …). Marketplace-installed commands are always
namespaced `plugin:command`, so the bare forms did not resolve when a user typed
them. Plugin bumps: `jackal-plan-and-execute` 3.0.1 → 3.0.2,
`jackal-supervisor` 3.0.0 → 3.0.1, `jackal-director` 1.0.0 → 1.0.1.

**Fixed:**
- Phase-boundary handoffs the user must type are now emitted namespaced —
  design → `/jackal-supervisor:jackal-impl-plan`, plan/impl-plan resume →
  `/jackal-plan-and-execute:execute`, and the director loop's
  `/jackal-director:contract-check` / `director-packet` / `ingest-directive`.
- Resumable-command emissions in `jackal-pause-session`, redirect/STOP messages,
  and "offer to run" prompts across `execute`, `finish`, `jackal-sweep`,
  `jackal-ui-verify`, and the supervisor agent.
- README command references (both plugin READMEs and the director README) now
  show the namespaced form, with a note that bare commands do not resolve.
- `scripts/trace-deps.sh` now includes `commands/` in the shipped inventory, so
  namespaced `plugin:command` references resolve instead of dangling.

## [jackal-plan-and-execute] 3.0.1

Design phase no longer stops to confirm the slug.

**Changed:**
- The `design` skill picks a sensible default slug — `<issue#>-<kebab-title>`,
  incorporating the GitHub issue number — and proceeds without asking. It only
  pauses when no slug can be derived (e.g. a too-vague freeform description).
  The user can still override afterward.

## [marketplace] 4.0.0 — director loop, PR-only lifecycle, no-nesting subagents

Major release: adds the `jackal-director` plugin (1.0.0), removes the todo-md
backlog backend, and makes the PR the only branch-completion path. Plugin bumps:
`jackal-plan-and-execute` 2.5.0 → 3.0.0, `jackal-supervisor` 2.5.0 → 3.0.0.

**Breaking:**
- **todo-md backend removed.** GitHub Issues is the only backlog; `gh_repo` is
  required. All `backend:` config keys, TODO.md parsing, and todo-md branches
  are gone from `execute`, `finish`, the supervisor agent, and every wrapper skill.
- **`finish` no longer presents merge/PR/keep/discard options.** It rebases onto
  origin/main when behind, pushes, and opens a PR — always. Keep/discard happen
  only on explicit user request; local merge to main no longer exists.

**New:**
- **`jackal-director` plugin (1.0.0)** — Software Director review loop: four
  Haiku court-reporter agents (`delta-scribe`, `contract-sentinel`,
  `lexicon-warden`, `registry-drift-checker`), `docs/canon/` scaffolding
  (`/canon-init`), a pre-PR conformance gate (`/contract-check`), cycle packets
  for the Director (`/director-packet`), and memo ingestion into ADRs, glossary,
  and `.jackal/*-guidance.md` (`/ingest-directive`). Contracts package and
  schema exporter are configurable (`contracts_pkg`, `schema_export_cmd`) and
  work for Pydantic and TypeScript (typebox/zod) alike.
- **Canon wiring across the lifecycle** (active only when `docs/canon/` exists):
  `design` reads charter/glossary and adds a Contract Impact section; `planner`
  drafts impact statements; `execute`'s final review runs `/contract-check` in
  parallel; `finish` gates the PR on CLEAN or explained-FLAGGED; the supervisor
  prompts when a director packet is due.
- **`reviewer-deep` agent (Opus)** — final review tier for Complex issues and
  auth/payments/user-data/crypto/contract diffs; `reviewer` (Sonnet) remains the
  default. Review is pre-PR; routine post-PR re-review is retired.
- **`jackal-sweep` skill + command** — reclaims worktrees/branches for merged
  PRs (worktree first, then branch — the order ad-hoc sync scripts get wrong),
  flags open PRs with `mergeStateStatus` BEHIND/DIRTY including the exact rebase
  command, fast-forwards main, and prunes.
- **Rebase-before-push in `finish`** — fetches origin, rebases when behind,
  re-runs tests, then pushes; semantic conflicts stop for a human.
- **Epics + backlog grooming in the supervisor** — `epic`-labeled tracking
  issues with task lists, `Part of #N` linkage at creation, epic-grouped status
  reports, and a groom workflow (mislabeled ready, orphaned in-progress, zombie
  worktrees, unprioritized issues, epic drift, PRs needing rebase).
- **Supervisor command files** — `/jackal-design-plan`, `/jackal-impl-plan`,
  `/jackal-finish-branch`, `/jackal-pause-session`, `/jackal-ui-verify`,
  `/jackal-sweep` are now real commands, so emitted handoffs are always typable.
- **AC checkbox closeout** — the final review's AC coverage table is posted as
  an issue comment and the body's checkboxes are ticked before the PR opens.

**Changed:**
- **Nested subagent spawning disabled** (matches upstream ed3d 1.12.0):
  `planner`, `implementor`, `reviewer`, `reviewer-deep` all carry
  `disallowedTools: Agent` plus an explicit no-nesting rule, and every dispatch
  prompt template in `design`/`plan`/`execute`/`review`/`finish` repeats the
  prohibition. The supervisor remains the only orchestrating tier.
- **Verbosity discipline:** hard report caps (planner 15 / implementor 20 /
  reviewer 40 / reviewer-deep 60 lines), no-narration rules, and `execute` now
  relays 3-line summaries instead of full worker reports.
- **Conflict gate fixed:** branch globs now include the go-forward
  `<type>/<issue#>-slug` convention (`'feature/*' '*/[0-9]*-*'`) in `plan`,
  `execute`, `jackal-design-plan`, and `jackal-impl-plan` — previously only
  `feature/*` was checked, so the gate never fired on new-convention branches.
- **Handoff commands are literal:** `plan` → execute continues via the Skill
  tool (or emits exactly `/execute <plan-dir> <worktree>`); the design handoff
  emits `/jackal-impl-plan <path>` verbatim. Invented names like
  `/execute-plan` are explicitly called out as nonexistent.
- READMEs rewritten: five-plugin layout, PR-only cycle, Director loop section,
  Bedrock model-mapping note (main conversation described as "the session
  model" rather than a hardcoded model name).


Fixes an invalid execution-command suggestion at phase handoff. Plugin bumps:
`jackal-plan-and-execute` 2.4.0 → 2.5.0, `jackal-supervisor` 2.4.0 → 2.5.0.

**Fixed:**
- **Plan directory honored the wrong path.** The `plan` skill and `planner` agent
  hardcoded `docs/implementation-plans/` when building `PLAN_DIR`, ignoring the
  `impl_plans` Jackal Config key. On projects that configure a different dir (e.g.
  ROAR's `docs/impl-plans`), phase files were written to one path while resume and
  handoff suggestions pointed at a non-existent `docs/implementation-plans/` —
  producing an invalid `/execute <dir>` command. Both now build `PLAN_DIR` from
  `IMPL_PLANS`/`impl_plans`, and the `plan` skill's wrapper-inputs list documents it.
- **`jackal-pause-session` resume suggestions** used the same hardcoded path. They
  now derive the plan dir from `impl_plans` and verify the directory exists (via
  `ls`) before emitting a resume command, so the suggested command is runnable.
- **`design` skill output path** now references the `design_plans` config key
  instead of a bare hardcoded `docs/design-plans/` (defensive consistency; the
  default is unchanged).

## [marketplace] 3.4.0 — GitHub issue hygiene

Tighten issue-creation and lifecycle hygiene in the supervisor. Plugin bumps:
`jackal-supervisor` 2.3.0 → 2.4.0, `jackal-plan-and-execute` 2.3.0 → 2.4.0.

**New:**
- **Dedup search before issue creation** — the supervisor's create workflow now
  runs `gh issue list --search` over open and closed issues first and stops on a
  plausible match instead of filing a duplicate.
- **Readiness validation** in `execute` Backlog mode — a `status/ready` label is no
  longer trusted on its own; issues whose body is still a template skeleton
  (placeholder ACs, unfilled scope) are reported as mislabelled and skipped rather
  than worked.
- **Priority-ordered selection** — `execute` Step 4 reads `priority/{high,medium,low}`
  to order work (was "highest-priority first" with nothing reading priority), and
  flags unprioritized ready issues.
- Label bootstrap now creates `priority/*` labels (and notes `module/*`), since the
  create workflow applies them at creation.

**Changed:**
- Issues are created with **all classifying labels at once** (`complexity/*` and,
  where defined, `priority/*` / `module/*`) instead of only `status/ready`, so the
  routing labels can't drift from the body.
- The assignee is now set (`--add-assignee "@me"`) on every `status/in-progress`
  transition — supervisor agent, `jackal-design-plan`, and `jackal-impl-plan` — so
  in-progress issues aren't orphaned in GitHub's UI, boards, and filters.
- Title guidance: default to a concise imperative title (bare issue numbers carry
  identity); planning-code prefixes are treated as transitional setup scaffolding,
  not the go-forward convention.

## [marketplace] 3.3.0 — harness coherence & ROAR alignment

Batched release fixing broken/dangling references, undeclared external dependencies, and
protected-main safety, surfaced by an audit against the ed3d predecessor, Claude Code harness
best practice, and the ROAR consuming repo. Plugin bumps: `jackal-plan-and-execute` 2.2.0 → 2.3.0,
`jackal-supervisor` 2.2.0 → 2.3.0, `jackal-house-style` 1.0.5 → 1.0.6.

**New:**
- `jackal-supervisor` now **ships the `jackal-supervisor` agent** (the orchestrating brain). It
  previously lived only in `~/.claude/agents/`, so a clean install got the wrapper skills but not
  the agent driving them.
- Ported `test-driven-development` and `verification-before-completion` skills into
  `jackal-plan-and-execute` (under their original names) — the `debug` skill required them but the
  ed3d→jackal rework had dropped them, leaving dangling references.
- `label_style` Jackal Config knob (`slash` | `colon`, default `slash`) — the harness now matches a
  project's label convention. ROAR and GitHub norm use slash-style (`status/ready`).
- `.jackal/harness-guidance.md` resolves **find-up** from the working directory to repo root
  (nearest-wins), so a monorepo can scope harness behavior per module.
- `marketplace.json` declares external `requires` (ed3d-research-agents, ed3d-extending-claude,
  ed3d-playwright); a README "Required dependencies" section documents the install.
- `scripts/trace-deps.sh` + `docs/test-plans/2026-06-16-harness-coherence.md` — a re-runnable
  dependency-trace gate (0 dangling refs) and verification plan.
- Restored `LICENSE.superpowers` (MIT, Jesse Vincent), required for the superpowers-derived code.

**Changed:**
- Autonomous `finish`/`execute` completion is now **protected-main-safe**: when `main` is protected
  (via `.jackal/harness-guidance.md`, `protected_main` config, or `gh` detection) the default is
  push + open PR instead of a local merge. `finish` Option 2 fills a repo `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- The `reviewer` now consumes the planner's `test-requirements.md` as an AC↔test coverage gate
  (previously written but never read).
- `implementor` uses module-scoped Conventional Commits when the project documents scopes.
- `debug` skill frontmatter renamed `systematic-debugging` → `debug` to match its dir/invocation.
- Top-level `README.md` rewritten for jackal (was the stale ed3d README: wrong title, 9-plugin
  layout, dead command names, ed3d install URL).
- `jackal-house-style` plugin.json rebranded (author, repo URL, description).

**Fixed:**
- `finish` no longer silently skips CLAUDE.md freshness re-verification when
  `ed3d-extending-claude` is absent — it emits a visible warning (ROAR makes closeout mandatory).
- `jackal-design-plan` hand-off prints the bare-integer `<type>/<issue#>-slug` branch format its own
  worktree step creates (was the legacy `feature/<module>/` form).
- Stale ed3d prose (`jackal-pause-session`: "ed3d skills create tasks" → "jackal skills").

## [jackal-house-style] 1.0.5

Align the Python skill's lint/security config with what ATLAS and Ledger Lens actually run in CI.

**Changed:**
- `howto-code-in-python` ruff config now matches real CI: `line-length = 300`, `select = ["E", "F", "W"]`, `ignore = ["E501"]`, file-scoped `per-file-ignores` for E402, and no `target-version` pin (CI runs Python 3.11). Was `line-length = 88`, `target-version = "py312"`, and a broad `extend-select` (I/UP/B/SIM/RUF) that no project enforced.
- bandit is now described as the mandatory PR gate at `-lll` (HIGH only), matching CI and the buildspecs — was `-ll` (LOW and above).
- semgrep downgraded from "MANDATORY on every project / required CI check" to a recommended deploy-time gate (as ATLAS runs it; Ledger Lens does not run it at all). Added `pip-audit` (advisory) and `detect-secrets` (gate) to reflect the real CI jobs.
- Dev dependencies shown under `[dependency-groups] dev` instead of the legacy `[tool.uv] dev-dependencies`. Updated the self-check, pyproject example, and Red Flags to match. Added a note warning against adding semgrep to PR checks to "match" a project that gates it at deploy.

## [jackal-supervisor] 2.2.0

GitHub is now the default backlog backend.

**Changed:**
- `backend` defaults to `github` (was `todo-md`) across `jackal-design-plan`, `jackal-impl-plan`, `jackal-pause-session`, and `jackal-finish-branch`. Projects must set `backend: todo-md` explicitly to use the TODO.md flow; `gh_repo` is required for the default GitHub path.
- `jackal-finish-branch` and `jackal-pause-session` skill descriptions reworded to present the GitHub backlog first, with TODO.md as the alternative.

**Fixed:**
- `jackal-pause-session` resume-checkpoint examples emitted the non-existent `/execute-implementation-plan` command (a stale ed3d-era name), so resuming into execution handed the user a dead command. They now use `/execute [plan-directory] [working-directory]` with the worktree passed as the working directory, so the resume command is runnable from the repo root.

## [jackal-plan-and-execute] 2.2.0

GitHub-first backlog narrative in execute and finish.

**Changed:**
- `execute` Backlog mode, delegation table, and supervisor-integration notes describe the backlog as GitHub issues by default (or TODO.md), instead of treating TODO.md as the primary mechanism. The explicit `backend: todo-md` branches are unchanged and fully supported.
- README architecture diagram, delegation table, and Continuous Execution section reworded to GitHub-first. `commands/execute.md` and `commands/finish.md` descriptions follow suit.

## [jackal-supervisor] 2.1.0

Single-owner worktree creation and optional GitHub backend for backlog state.

**New:**
- `jackal-design-plan` now owns worktree creation. Creates the worktree, runs the conflict gate, and persists a `## Worktree` block (branch, path, created date) to the issue doc as the single source of truth.
- GitHub backend support across `jackal-design-plan`, `jackal-impl-plan`, `jackal-pause-session`, and `jackal-finish-branch`. Opt in by setting `backend: github` and `gh_repo: owner/repo` in the project's Jackal Config.
- Standard label set: `status:ready`, `status:in-progress`, `status:paused`, `status:blocked`. Wrappers add/remove labels and post structured comments at worktree assignment, pause/blocked checkpoints, and completion.

**Changed:**
- `jackal-impl-plan` step 3 reads the `## Worktree` block from the issue doc instead of re-deriving the path. Falls back to creating a worktree only for Standard issues that skipped `/jackal-design-plan`. Three explicit cases (block found + path exists / block found + path missing / no block) so the skill never silently bails.
- `jackal-finish-branch` posts a completion comment with merge commit or PR URL, removes `status:in-progress`, and closes the issue on local merge (Option 1). PR-based finishes leave closing to GitHub via "Closes #N" in the PR body.
- `jackal-pause-session` swaps `status:in-progress` for `status:paused` (or `status:blocked`) and posts the checkpoint as a comment when `backend: github`.

**Fixed:**
- "Could not find worktree" handoff failure between `/jackal-design-plan` and `/jackal-impl-plan` caused by both skills trying to create the worktree and re-derive its name from convention.

## [jackal-plan-and-execute] 2.1.0

Worktree input pass-through and GitHub backlog backend in execute/finish.

**New:**
- `plan` skill accepts `WORKTREE_PATH` from its wrapper — when provided, skips its own conflict gate + worktree creation. The wrapper is the single owner of worktree state.
- `execute` Backlog mode reads from GitHub issues (`gh issue list --label status:ready --state open`) when `backend: github`. TODO.md remains the default and is fully supported.
- `design` skill accepts `WORKTREE_PATH` and runs its design-doc commit from the worktree, so the design document lands on the feature branch instead of `main`.

**Changed:**
- `finish` skill step 6 gates TODO.md updates on `backend`. With `backend: github`, GitHub is the source of truth and the wrapper handles the close + comment.

## [jackal-house-style] 1.0.4

Make `bandit` and `semgrep` mandatory on every Python project.

**Changed:**
- `howto-code-in-python`: bandit and semgrep are required, not optional, and not interchangeable. Added a Security Scanning section with installation (`uv add --dev bandit semgrep`), `[tool.bandit]` config, run commands, suppression policy (line-local with reason — never repo-wide), and CI requirements. Updated the self-check, `pyproject.toml` example, and Red Flags to enforce both scanners on every commit.

## [jackal-linear] 1.0.0

Initial release of the jackal-linear plugin.

**New:**
- `/start-from-linear [ISSUE-ID]` command: fetches Linear issue, sets it to In Progress, seeds the `starting-a-design-plan` workflow with issue context
- `linear-workflow` skill: start mode (issue fetch + In Progress status) and finish mode (In Review on PR, Done on merge)
- `writing-for-linear` skill: content standards for Linear comments, status-change updates, and issue descriptions
- PostToolUse hook: detects `gh pr create` and `git merge` commands, injects Linear reminder when `.linear-issue` is present
- Linear MCP server registered via `mcp-remote` pointing to `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp` (OAuth 2.1)

## ed3d-house-style 1.0.3

Relax FCIS file classification to target only files with runtime behavior.

**Changed:**
- FCIS skill: classification now mandatory only for files containing runtime logic (functions, classes with methods, orchestration)
- FCIS skill: added exemptions for type-only files, constants, barrels, tests, and generated files
- FCIS skill: added threshold note — exempt files that grow to include runtime logic must be classified
- TypeScript skill: added clarifying note in FCIS Integration section about exemptions

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.10.3

Add session isolation for parallel planning/execution to prevent file collisions.

**New:**
- `SCRATCHPAD_DIR` parameter with unique session ID (e.g., `/tmp/plan-2025-01-24-feature-a7f3b2/`) ensures isolation when multiple planning or execution sessions run in parallel
- Random session ID component prevents collisions on retry attempts

**Changed:**
- `writing-implementation-plans`: creates and passes SCRATCHPAD_DIR to code-reviewer in Finalization step
- `executing-an-implementation-plan`: creates SCRATCHPAD_DIR at startup, passes to all code review invocations
- `requesting-code-review`: accepts and forwards SCRATCHPAD_DIR to code-reviewer subagent
- `code-reviewer` agent: documents SCRATCHPAD_DIR usage for any scratch files

## ed3d-extending-claude 1.1.0

Adds marketplace management skill for creating and maintaining Claude Code Plugin Marketplaces.

**New:**
- `maintaining-a-marketplace` skill covering marketplace.json schema, version management, release checklists, changelog conventions, validation, and distribution — generalizable for any user publishing a marketplace

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.10.2

Fix typo in planning handoff command.

**Fixed:**
- `starting-a-design-plan`: Phase 6 handoff command had `/ed3d-ed3d-plan-and-execute:start-implementation-plan` instead of `/ed3d-plan-and-execute:start-implementation-plan`

## ed3d-extending-claude 1.0.4

Add model-level testing guidance to testing-skills-with-subagents.

**Changed:**
- `testing-skills-with-subagents`: RED phase should use production-level model (default: Sonnet); GREEN/REFACTOR phases should use one tier down (default: Haiku) to ensure skill clarity under weaker reasoning
- Quick reference table now includes model column

## ed3d-basic-agents 1.1.0

Add fan-out analysis skill for large corpus processing.

**New:**
- `doing-a-simple-two-stage-fanout` skill: orchestrates parallel Worker subagents, Critic review subagents, and a Summarizer for analyzing corpora that exceed a single agent's context window
- `compute_layout.py` helper script for computing segment counts, agent assignments, and context window budgets
- `diagram-templates.md` reference with Mermaid and Graphviz templates for visualizing fan-out pipelines
- First `user-invocable: true` skill in this plugin

## [ed3d-hook-skill-reinforcement] 1.0.1, [ed3d-plan-and-execute] 1.10.1, [ed3d-basic-agents] 1.0.2, [ed3d-extending-claude] 1.0.3

Remove stale `<available_skills>` XML tag references that no longer match how Claude Code injects skill lists.

**Fixed:**
- Replaced all references to `<available_skills>` with format-agnostic language ("your available skills shown in your system context") across hooks, skills, and agent prompts
- Hook reminder now uses emphatic "MUST" / "Do NOT skip" phrasing for stronger compliance
- Added warning comment in CLAUDE_MD_TESTING.md example to prevent re-introducing the stale tag

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.10.0

Scoped acceptance criteria for cross-plan uniqueness.

**New:**
- AC identifiers now use scoped format `{slug}.AC{N}.{M}` (e.g., `oauth2-svc-authn.AC1.1`) to prevent collisions across multiple plan-and-execute rounds
- Design plan naming now prompts user explicitly via AskUserQuestion — supports ticket names (e.g., `PROJ-1234`) or descriptive slugs
- Slug naming guidance: prefer terse unambiguous names (`authn` not `authentication`, but not `auth` since ambiguous with `authz`)

**Changed:**
- `starting-a-design-plan`: Added Step 1 to get design plan name before file creation
- `starting-an-implementation-plan`: Slug definition now documents its three uses (directory, worktree, AC scope)
- `writing-design-plans`: AC structure uses scoped format with slug prefix
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Task templates and AC coverage sections use scoped format
- `executing-an-implementation-plan`: AC coverage check references scoped format
- All examples updated to use terse slugs (e.g., `oauth2-svc-authn` instead of `oauth2-service-auth`)

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.9.8

Disables user invocation of skills.

**Changed:**
- All skills now have `user-invocable: false` — skills are auto-invoked by Claude based on description matching but won't appear in the `/` slash command menu

## ed3d-house-style 1.0.2

Disables user invocation of skills.

**Changed:**
- All skills now have `user-invocable: false` — skills are auto-invoked by Claude based on description matching but won't appear in the `/` slash command menu

## ed3d-extending-claude 1.0.2

Disables user invocation of skills.

**Changed:**
- All skills now have `user-invocable: false` — skills are auto-invoked by Claude based on description matching but won't appear in the `/` slash command menu

## ed3d-basic-agents 1.0.1

Disables user invocation of skills.

**Changed:**
- All skills now have `user-invocable: false` — skills are auto-invoked by Claude based on description matching but won't appear in the `/` slash command menu

## ed3d-playwright 1.0.1

Disables user invocation of skills.

**Changed:**
- All skills now have `user-invocable: false` — skills are auto-invoked by Claude based on description matching but won't appear in the `/` slash command menu

## ed3d-research-agents 1.0.1

Disables user invocation of skills.

**Changed:**
- All skills now have `user-invocable: false` — skills are auto-invoked by Claude based on description matching but won't appear in the `/` slash command menu

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.9.7

Adds AC coverage verification, compaction-safe task tracking for review fixes, and test plan reminder.

**Changed:**
- `executing-an-implementation-plan`: Final code review now includes AC_COVERAGE_CHECK — verifies all acceptance criteria are covered by at least one phase
- `executing-an-implementation-plan`: When code reviewer returns issues, create ONE TASK PER ISSUE with VERBATIM description — survives compaction
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Same per-issue task creation for finalization code review fixes
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Same per-revision task creation for test requirements approval
- `finishing-a-development-branch`: Reminds user to review human test plan (if exists) before considering work complete

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.9.6

Requires verbatim task names to prevent instruction loss.

**Fixed:**
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Task names must be copied VERBATIM, not paraphrased — phrases like "and activate relevant skills" trigger behavior post-compaction

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.9.5

Dynamic skill activation replaces hardcoded requirements.

**Changed:**
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Removed hardcoded "REQUIRED SKILL: coding-effectively"
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Task NB now "Investigate codebase for Phase N and activate relevant skills"
- Skills activated dynamically based on codebase findings, not statically at skill start

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.9.4

Activates relevant skills during implementation planning based on technology stack.

**Changed:**
- `writing-implementation-plans`: After codebase investigation, activate skills matching the technologies involved (TypeScript, React, database, etc.) if not already active

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.9.3

Adds guidance to prevent over-testing and testing implementation details.

**Changed:**
- `writing-implementation-plans`: "Test behavior, not implementation" — test outputs, not how you called dependencies
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Infrastructure phases explicitly state "Verifies: None" instead of inventing ACs
- `writing-implementation-plans`: What doesn't need tests: types, already-tested dependencies, call patterns
- `writing-implementation-plans`: New rationalizations for common over-testing mistakes

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.9.2

Ties tests explicitly to acceptance criteria; removes test code from implementation plans.

**Changed:**
- `writing-design-plans`: Functionality phases must have tests that verify the specific ACs they cover; phase not "done" until tests exist for each listed AC case
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Functionality tasks include "Verifies: AC1.1, AC1.3" field; tests described by AC reference, not full code
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Task-implementor generates actual test code at execution time with fresh codebase context

**Why:** Test code in plans becomes stale (wrong imports, mock patterns). AC text like "Invalid password returns 401" is already a clear test spec.

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.9.1

Strengthens acceptance criteria generation and adds traceability to implementation plans.

**Changed:**
- `writing-design-plans`: Acceptance Criteria now generated inline (no subagent needed) with detailed guidance on enumerating success cases, failure cases, and edge cases for each DoD item
- `writing-design-plans`: AC uses numbered format (AC1, AC1.1, AC1.2) for precise traceability
- `writing-design-plans`: AC section moved to legibility header (between DoD and Glossary)
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Phase headers now include "Acceptance Criteria Coverage" section listing which ACs the phase implements
- `writing-implementation-plans`: AC entries copied literally from design plan—no paraphrasing
- `starting-a-design-plan`: Initial document template includes AC placeholder

**Traceability chain:**
```
Design: AC1.1, AC1.2, AC1.3 → Phase header: "implements AC1.1, AC1.3" → Tasks produce tests for AC1.1, AC1.3
```

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.9.0

Adds test planning workflow: acceptance criteria, test requirements, and human test plans.

**New:**
- **Acceptance Criteria** in design plans — Definition of Done translated into specific, verifiable criteria; human validates before design documentation completes
- **Test Requirements** in implementation plans — Acceptance criteria mapped to automated tests (with expected file paths) or documented as requiring human verification; written to `test-requirements.md`
- **test-analyst agent** — Validates test coverage against acceptance criteria after final code review; generates human test plan when coverage passes
- **Human Test Plans** — Written to `docs/test-plans/[design-plan-name].md` with specific verification steps, end-to-end scenarios, and traceability to Definition of Done

**Changed:**
- `writing-design-plans`: New section for generating and validating Acceptance Criteria after Implementation Phases
- `writing-implementation-plans`: New Test Requirements task after Finalization; Opus subagent generates `test-requirements.md`
- `executing-an-implementation-plan`: Final review sequence now includes test-analyst for coverage validation and test plan generation

**Test traceability chain:**
```
Definition of Done → Acceptance Criteria → Test Requirements → Automated Tests → Human Test Plan
```

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.8.0

Per-phase code reviews now use project-specific implementation guidance.

**Changed:**
- `executing-an-implementation-plan`: Per-phase code reviews now receive the `.ed3d/implementation-plan-guidance.md` file (when it exists) so reviewers apply project-specific coding standards, testing requirements, and review criteria during each phase—not just during the final all-phases review

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.7.2

- `/how-to-customize` given more specific instructions to actually repeat the information verbatim.

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.7.0

Adds project-specific guidance files for customizing design and implementation plans.

**New:**
- **Project guidance files**: Create `.ed3d/design-plan-guidance.md` and `.ed3d/implementation-plan-guidance.md` to provide project-specific constraints, terminology, and standards
- **`/how-to-customize` command**: Documents available guidance files with examples
- **Design guidance**: Loaded before clarification phase — defines domain terminology, architectural constraints, technology preferences
- **Implementation guidance**: Loaded when starting implementation plans AND during final code review — specifies coding standards, testing requirements, review criteria

**Changed:**
- `starting-a-design-plan`: Checks for and reads `.ed3d/design-plan-guidance.md` between Phase 1 (Context Gathering) and Phase 2 (Clarification)
- `starting-an-implementation-plan`: Checks for and reads `.ed3d/implementation-plan-guidance.md` after branch setup
- `writing-implementation-plans`: Includes guidance path in Finalization task for code reviewer

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.6.2

Fixes "Re-read skill" task dependency ordering.

**Fixed:**
- "Re-read skill" task must be re-pointed to Finalization task after granular tasks are created (was incorrectly blocked by "Create implementation plan")
- Added "After Planning: Update Dependencies" step to ensure correct task ordering

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.6.1

Fixes task tracking to include dependencies and absolute paths.

**Fixed:**
- Tasks now use addBlockedBy to enforce execution order (NA→NB→NC→ND, then next phase)
- Task descriptions include absolute paths for design file and output file, so tasks remain actionable after compaction

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.6.0

Adds granular task tracking to implementation plan writing to survive context compaction.

**New in `writing-implementation-plans`:**
- **Granular per-phase tasks:** Instead of one task per phase, now creates sub-tasks for each step:
  - Phase NA: Read [Phase Name] from design plan
  - Phase NB: Dispatch codebase-investigator to verify current state
  - Phase NC: Research external dependencies (if applicable)
  - Phase ND: Write phase file to disk
- **Finalization task:** Explicitly states "fix ALL issues including minor ones" — model cannot rationalize skipping minor issues
- **Plan validation as tracked task:** Must complete with zero issues before handoff

**New in `writing-design-plans`:**
- **Phase markers:** Design plans now require `<!-- START_PHASE_N -->` / `<!-- END_PHASE_N -->` markers around each implementation phase, enabling granular parsing

**New in `starting-an-implementation-plan`:**
- **Orchestration tasks:** Tracks Branch setup, Create implementation plan, Re-read skill, Execution handoff
- **Restore context step:** Re-reads skill before handoff to restore instructions post-compaction
- **Terminology clarification:** Renamed "Phase 1/2/3" to descriptive names (Branch Setup, Planning, Execution Handoff) to avoid confusion with implementation plan phases

**Fixed:**
- Code reviewer step was being forgotten after compaction — now tracked as explicit Finalization task
- Minor issues were being skipped — task text now makes fixing them mandatory

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.5.1

Updates task tracking references for compatibility with new Claude Code task system.

**Changed:**
- All references to `TodoWrite` now prefer `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList` (the new task tools in Claude Code)
- Backwards-compatibility notes added for older Claude Code versions that still use `TodoWrite`

## ed3d-extending-claude 1.0.1

Updates task tracking references for compatibility with new Claude Code task system.

**Changed:**
- Tool tables and examples now reference `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` instead of `TodoWrite`
- Backwards-compatibility notes added for older Claude Code versions

## ed3d-house-style 1.0.1

Updates task tracking references for compatibility with new Claude Code task system.

**Changed:**
- Persuasion principles documentation now references `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` instead of `TodoWrite`
- Backwards-compatibility notes added for older Claude Code versions

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.5.0

Promotes experimental execution workflow to stable.

**Changed:**
- Execution workflow now uses just-in-time phase loading (reads one phase at a time, not all upfront)
- Code review happens once per phase instead of between every task
- TodoWrite structure: three entries per phase (Read, Execute, Code review) with absolute paths and titles
- Subagents receive phase file path and read it themselves

**Removed:**
- Experimental skill and command (merged into stable)
- Task grouping by subcomponent (plan phases now define grouping via markers)
- Task-level code review (replaced with phase-level review)

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.4.3

Removes misleading directive from implementation plan header.

**Fixed:**
- Removed "For Claude: REQUIRED SUB-SKILL" directive from plan header template — was being parsed by task-implementor subagent when it should only be used at the top-level orchestrator

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.4.2

Simplifies experimental execution workflow.

**Changed:**
- Experimental skill now reads first 10 lines (not 3) to capture Goal in header
- Subagents (task-implementor, bug-fixer) now read entire phase file instead of extracted sections
- Removed context window extraction logic — simpler approach, let subagents see full phase context

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.4.1

Adds experimental execution workflow and task markers. (1.4.0 was a buggy mis-push.)

**New:**
- **Task and subcomponent markers** in implementation plans: `<!-- START_TASK_N -->`, `<!-- END_TASK_N -->`, `<!-- START_SUBCOMPONENT_A (tasks 3-5) -->`, etc.
- **Experimental execution skill** (`executing-an-implementation-plan-experimental`) with just-in-time phase loading, context windows for subagents, and marker-based extraction
- **Experimental command** (`/execute-implementation-plan-experimental`) to invoke the experimental workflow

**Changed:**
- `writing-implementation-plans` now generates markers in all task templates (backwards compatible — old execution skill ignores them)

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.3.3

Fixes execution handoff to use absolute paths, preventing wrong-directory issues after /clear.

**Fixed:**
- Execution handoff now captures absolute paths via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and verifies plan directory exists before outputting command
- After `/clear`, users land in the original session directory (often repo root, not worktree) — absolute paths ensure execution happens in the correct directory regardless

**Changed:**
- `/execute-implementation-plan` command now accepts two arguments: `[absolute-plan-dir]` and `[absolute-working-dir]`
- Command verifies both paths exist and changes to working directory before engaging skill

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.3.2

Fixes execution handoff to pass plan directory instead of single phase file.

**Fixed:**
- Execute-implementation-plan instructions now pass the plan directory (e.g., `@docs/implementation-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature/`) instead of a single phase file — prevents agent from only implementing the first phase

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.3.1

Improves resolution of Definition of Done in design plans.

**Changed:**
- Definition of Done is now written to the design document immediately after user confirmation (Phase 3), rather than being reconstructed later during documentation (Phase 5)
- Design document file is created in Phase 3 with DoD and placeholders for Summary/Glossary
- writing-design-plans skill now appends body sections and generates only Summary/Glossary

**Fixed:**
- Corrected stale skill name references ("subagent-driven-development", "executing-plans") to "executing-an-implementation-plan"
- Reinforced that Minor issues from code review must be fixed (model was skipping them)
- Changed `/compact` to `/clear` between phases, with warning to copy next command first

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.3.0

Adds legibility header to design plans for human reviewers.

**New:**
- **Phase 3: Definition of Done** — New checkpoint after clarification to confirm deliverables before brainstorming
- **Legibility header** — Design plans now include Definition of Done, Summary, and Glossary sections at the top
- **Subagent extraction** — Uses fresh-context subagent to generate legibility header after writing body
- **Glossary transparency** — Subagent reports omitted "obvious" terms so user can request additions

**Changed:**
- Phases renumbered 1-6 (was 1, 2, 2b, 3, 4, 5)
- Task invocations in skills now use XML block format

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.2.0

Added external dependency research capabilities to implementation planning.

**Changed:**
- **writing-implementation-plans**: Added tiered external dependency research workflow. Phases involving external libraries now trigger research via `internet-researcher` (for docs/standards) with escalation to `remote-code-researcher` (for source code) when documentation is insufficient.

**New capabilities:**
- Decision framework for when to research external dependencies
- Tiered research approach: docs first, source code when needed
- External dependency findings section in phase output templates
- Updated per-phase workflow to include research step
- New rationalizations to prevent skipping external research

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.1.0

Corrects design plan level of detail. These changes were a missed port from the internal plugin marketplace and were intended for 1.0.0. This release represents the plugin "as intended."

**Changed:**
- **writing-design-plans**: Design plans now stay at component/module level, not task level. Contracts/interfaces can be fully specified; implementation code cannot.
- **brainstorming**: Added guidance on level of detail in Phase 3. Validates boundaries, not behavior.
- **writing-implementation-plans**: Strengthened codebase verification as source of truth. Implementation plans generate code fresh from investigation, never copy from design.
- **README**: Added "Philosophy: What Each Phase Produces" section explaining archival vs just-in-time distinction.

## ed3d-research-agents 1.1.0

Added `remote-code-researcher` agent for investigating external codebases by cloning and analyzing their source code.

**New agent:**
- `remote-code-researcher` - Answers questions about external libraries/frameworks by cloning repos to temp directories and investigating the actual source code. Combines web search (to find repos) with codebase investigation (to analyze cloned code).

## All plugins 1.0.0

Initial release of ed3d-plugins collection.
