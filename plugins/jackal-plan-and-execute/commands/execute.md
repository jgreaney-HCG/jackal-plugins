# Execute

**Plan directory:** `$1` (optional — if omitted, enters Backlog mode)
**Working directory:** `$2` (optional — defaults to current)

Invoke the `execute` skill.

- With arguments: executes the specified implementation plan
- Without arguments: enters continuous backlog mode (reads the backlog — GitHub issues by default, or TODO.md — and dispatches until stuck)
