# Execute

Two modes:
1. **Plan mode** — execute a specific implementation plan (phase files in a directory)
2. **Backlog mode** — continuously pull and execute issues from TODO.md until stuck

---

## Mode 1: Execute an Implementation Plan

**Input:** path to plan directory (contains `phase_NN.md` files)

### Process

1. List phase files, read headers only (first 10 lines each)
2. For each phase sequentially:
   a. Read the phase file
   b. Dispatch `implementor` with the phase file path and working directory
   c. Print the implementor's full report
   d. Decide whether to review (see Review Routing below)
3. After all phases: run final review, then hand off to `finish` skill

### Review Routing

After each phase completes, decide:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Phase touches auth, payments, user data, or crypto | Full review |
| Phase is the final phase | Full review |
| Implementor's self-review flagged uncertainty | Full review |
| Phase is pure infrastructure/config | Skip review |
| All other phases | Skip per-phase review; catch issues in final review |

**Final review is always mandatory.** It covers the full diff from plan start to completion.

When review finds Critical or Important issues:
1. Dispatch `implementor` with the issues list and instruction to fix
2. Re-run review
3. If same issues persist after 3 cycles → stop, report to human

Minor issues from the final review: report them, don't block.

---

## Mode 2: Continuous Backlog Execution

**Input:** none (reads from project's TODO.md)

This is the autonomous orchestration loop. The orchestrator (you, running in the main conversation) drives issues to completion without human intervention, stopping only when genuinely stuck.

### The Loop

```
while true:
  1. Read TODO.md (stop at RESOLVED_SECTION_START)
  2. Identify unblocked issues in Ready
  3. Run conflict gate on candidates
  4. Select issue(s) to work on
  5. Execute issue (route by complexity)
  6. Merge result
  7. Report completion (one-liner)
  8. Loop back to step 1
```

### Step 1: Read Backlog State

```bash
sed '/RESOLVED_SECTION_START/q' $REPO_ROOT/TODO.md
```

Parse: Active, Paused, Ready, Backlog, Blocked tables.

### Step 2: Identify Unblocked Work

Read each Ready issue's doc. Check its `Blocked by:` field.
An issue is unblocked when all its blockers are in Resolved.

### Step 3: Conflict Gate

For each unblocked candidate:

```bash
for branch in $(git branch --list 'feature/*' | tr -d ' '); do
  echo "=== $branch ==="
  git diff --name-only main...$branch 2>/dev/null
done
```

Compare active branch file sets against candidate's `In scope:` paths.
- Same file touched → hard block
- Same directory, different files → soft warning (proceed with note)
- No overlap → clear

### Step 4: Select Work

If multiple candidates are unblocked and clear:
- Check for independence (no shared files, no dependency between them)
- If independent: dispatch in parallel (two implementors, two worktrees)
- If dependent: execute highest-priority first

### Step 5: Execute by Complexity

Read the issue doc's `Complexity` field:

**Simple** (≤1 day, bug fix, single concern):
- Create worktree
- Dispatch `implementor` directly with issue doc
- No plan phase, no design phase
- Review only if security-sensitive

**Standard** (multi-file, clear ACs):
- Create worktree
- Dispatch `planner` with issue doc (it generates a mini design plan + phase files)
- Execute phases sequentially (Mode 1 above)

**Complex** (architectural decisions, ambiguous scope):
- STOP. Report: "CG-XX is Complex — needs design decisions. Run /design to start."
- Do not attempt autonomous execution of Complex issues.

### Step 6: Merge and Update

After issue passes review:
1. Merge worktree branch to main
2. Update issue doc: Status → Done
3. Update TODO.md: move to Resolved, update "Last updated"
4. Remove worktree

### Step 7: Report

Print one line:
```
✓ CG-XX merged. [brief what]. Starting CG-YY next (also dispatching CG-ZZ in parallel).
```

### Stop Conditions

Stop the loop and report to human when:
- No unblocked issues remain in Ready/Backlog
- All unblocked issues are Complex
- Conflict gate blocks all candidates
- An issue fails review 3 times
- A genuine ambiguity needs human decision (unclear AC, missing dependency, env issue)

Report clearly:
```
Stopped: [reason]
Completed this session: CG-X, CG-Y, CG-Z
Next unblocked: CG-A (waiting for [what])
Blocked: CG-B (conflict with [branch])
```

---

## Parallel Dispatch

When two issues are independent:

```
Dispatch in single message:
  Agent(implementor): CG-XX in worktree A
  Agent(implementor): CG-YY in worktree B
```

Both run concurrently. When both return:
- Review each independently
- Merge each to main (one at a time, re-run tests after each merge)
- If merge conflict arises: merge the higher-priority one first, then rebase the other

---

## Worktree Management

Every issue gets its own worktree:

```bash
ISSUE_ID="CG-XX"
SLUG="kebab-title"
MODULE="module-short"  # from issue doc Module field

# Ensure .worktrees is gitignored
grep -q "\.worktrees" .gitignore || echo ".worktrees/" >> .gitignore

# Create (or reuse existing)
if [ ! -d ".worktrees/${ISSUE_ID}-${SLUG}" ]; then
  git worktree add .worktrees/${ISSUE_ID}-${SLUG} \
    -b feature/${MODULE}/${ISSUE_ID}-${SLUG} main
fi
```

Pass the worktree absolute path to every implementor dispatch.

---

## Context Strategy

With 1M context window:
- Never /clear between issues
- Accumulated knowledge improves each subsequent dispatch
- Phase files read just-in-time (not all upfront) to avoid noise
- Implementor reports kept in context (orchestrator learns patterns)

If context genuinely runs low (>600K tokens used), summarize completed work and continue. Don't clear.

---

## Integration with Supervisor

The supervisor (jackal-supervisor agent or skills) handles:
- Creating issues, managing backlog priority
- Assigning work (conflict gate + worktree creation)
- Pausing/resuming

This skill handles:
- Executing assigned work
- Merging completed work
- Updating TODO.md post-completion

They can run together: supervisor assigns, execute runs. Or execute can self-serve from TODO.md in autonomous mode.
