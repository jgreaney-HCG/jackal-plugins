# Finish

Complete a development branch after implementation passes review.

---

## Process

### 1. UI Verification (if applicable)

Read `ui_path` from the Jackal Config in CLAUDE.md. Check whether this branch touched any files under that path:

```bash
UI_PATH=$(grep 'ui_path' CLAUDE.md | awk '{print $2}')
git diff --name-only main...[feature-branch] | grep "^${UI_PATH}"
```

If any UI files changed: invoke `jackal-ui-verify` with the issue ID. **Do not proceed to merge until it reports ✅ PASS.**

If no UI files changed: skip this step.

### 2. Verify Tests Pass

```bash
$TEST_CMD
```

If tests fail → stop. Report failures. Don't proceed.

### 3. Present Options

```
Implementation complete. Options:

1. Merge back to main locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (more work needed / I'll handle it)
4. Discard this work
```

### 4. Execute Choice

**Option 1 — Merge locally:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git merge [feature-branch]
$TEST_CMD                    # verify merged result
git branch -d [feature-branch]
```

**Option 2 — Push and create PR:**
```bash
git push -u origin [feature-branch]
gh pr create --title "[ISSUE-ID]: [title]" --body "..."
```

If project uses CodeCommit (check `pr_method` in Jackal Config):
```
Branch pushed. Create PR via:
aws codecommit create-pull-request ...
```

**Option 3 — Keep:**
Report branch and worktree location. Done.

**Option 4 — Discard:**
Require typed "discard" confirmation. Then:
```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D [feature-branch]
```

### 5. Update Project Context

For Options 1 and 2, dispatch the project-claude-librarian (if available) to update CLAUDE.md files if contracts changed:

```xml
<invoke name="Agent">
<parameter name="subagent_type">ed3d-extending-claude:project-claude-librarian</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Updating project context</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">
Review changes on [feature-branch] vs main.
Update CLAUDE.md files if API contracts or project structure changed.
Working directory: [path]
</parameter>
</invoke>
```

If the plugin isn't available, skip this step.

### 6. Update Backlog State and Issue Doc

Read `backend` from `## Jackal Config`. The wrapper (`jackal-finish-branch`) handles GitHub-side updates (labels, comment, close) for Options 1 and 2. This skill's job is local file updates only.

For Options 1 and 2:
- Issue doc: set Status → Done
- If `backend: todo-md`: remove from Active, append to Resolved with today's date, update "Last updated" line
- If `backend: github`: skip TODO.md updates (GH is the source of truth — the wrapper closes the issue)

For Option 4:
- If `backend: todo-md`: remove from Active, don't add to Resolved
- If `backend: github`: leave the issue open with `status:ready` (work was discarded — issue is still pending)

### 7. Clean Up Worktree

For Options 1, 2, 4:
```bash
git worktree remove [worktree-path]
```

For Option 3: keep worktree.

### 8. Test Plan Reminder

If `docs/test-plans/` has a file matching this issue, remind the user it exists.

## Autonomous Mode

When called from the continuous execution loop (Backlog mode), the orchestrator should:
- Always choose Option 1 (merge locally) without asking
- Skip the "present options" step
- Proceed directly to merge, update, cleanup

The 4-option menu is for interactive use only.
