# Review

Dispatch the right reviewer agent and handle the result.

## Choose the Tier

- **`reviewer`** (Sonnet) — default: Simple and Standard issues, per-phase reviews.
- **`reviewer-deep`** (Opus) — final review of Complex issues, or any diff
  touching auth, payments, user data, crypto, or the project's contract
  sources (the contracts package, or per-component contract files named in
  `docs/canon/registry.md`).

## Dispatch

```xml
<invoke name="Agent">
<parameter name="subagent_type">jackal-plan-and-execute:reviewer</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Reviewing [what]</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">
WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED: [summary]
PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS: [path to phase file or issue doc]
BASE_SHA: [commit before work]
HEAD_SHA: [current commit]
Working directory: [path]

[If the plan dir has a test-requirements.md:]
TEST_REQUIREMENTS: [path to <plan-dir>/test-requirements.md]

[If implementation guidance exists:]
GUIDANCE: [path to .jackal/implementation-guidance.md]

Do not dispatch or invoke any subagents — run all verification directly with your own tools.
</parameter>
</invoke>
```

(Substitute `jackal-plan-and-execute:reviewer-deep` when the tier calls for it.)

## Handle Response

### PASS (no Critical/Important issues)
Proceed. Note any Minor issues in your report but don't act on them.

### ISSUES_FOUND (Critical or Important)
1. Dispatch `implementor` with the issues list:
   ```
   Fix these review issues:
   [paste issues verbatim]

   Working directory: [path]
   Fix all Critical and Important issues. Verify with tests. Commit.
   Do not dispatch or invoke any subagents — do the work directly with your own tools.
   ```
2. After fix, re-dispatch reviewer with PRIOR_ISSUES added to prompt
3. If same issues persist after 3 cycles → stop, report to human

### BLOCKED (tests fail / build broken)
The implementor left broken code. Dispatch implementor to fix:
```
Tests/build are failing. Fix before we can review.
Error output: [paste]
Working directory: [path]
```

## Context Limit Handling

If reviewer returns empty or truncated response:
1. First retry: narrow scope to changed files only
2. Second retry: split review into two halves (first N/2 commits, then remaining)
3. Third failure: stop, report to human

## When to Skip Review

The `execute` skill decides whether to invoke this skill. This skill itself always runs a full review when called — it doesn't make skip decisions.
