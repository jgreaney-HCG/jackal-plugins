# Design

Transform a rough idea or Complex issue into a committed design document ready for implementation planning.

**Output:** `<design_plans>/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md` — where `<design_plans>` is the
`design_plans` path from the project's `## Jackal Config` (defaults to
`docs/design-plans`). Use the configured value; the examples below show the default.

---

## Harness Guidance

Before starting, resolve `.jackal/harness-guidance.md` and `.jackal/design-guidance.md` by walking up
from the working directory to the repo root (nearest-wins — a module-level `.jackal/` overrides the
root one; see the `execute` skill's Harness Guidance for the resolution snippet). Read what's present
and apply project-specific constraints before step 2.

## Canon (if `docs/canon/` exists)

Read `docs/canon/charter.md` and `docs/canon/glossary.md` **before brainstorming**.
The charter's design theory and invariants constrain every approach you propose;
the glossary's terms are the only names for the concepts they define. If the
design needs a concept the glossary lacks, say so explicitly in the design doc —
never coin a term silently. If the design touches any contract model (files
under the contracts package named in `docs/canon/registry.md`), the design doc
must include a **Contract impact** section and the plan phase must draft the
impact statement in `docs/canon/impact/` — a contract change without one will be
flagged by contract-sentinel and stall the PR.

## Delegation Rules

The design skill handles user interaction and commits the design document. Research is always delegated.

| Do directly | Delegate |
|---|---|
| Confirm DoD with user | Codebase investigation → `codebase-investigator` |
| Brainstorm approaches, write design doc | External tech research → `combined-researcher` |
| Commit design doc to git | |

Do not use Bash/Read/Grep to investigate the codebase yourself — dispatch `codebase-investigator` so its findings land in a clean subagent context and don't bloat the main conversation.

---

## Inputs

When invoked from `jackal-design-plan`, the wrapper passes:
- `WORKTREE_PATH` — absolute path to the feature worktree (already created)
- `BRANCH` — feature branch name
- `ISSUE_ID` — issue identifier
- `SLUG` — pre-determined slug

When invoked directly, accept any of:
- An issue ID (e.g., CG-14)
- An issue doc path
- A freeform description of what to build

If `WORKTREE_PATH` is provided, **all git operations in this skill run from inside `$WORKTREE_PATH`** so the design document commits land on the feature branch, not main. If not provided, the design document commits to main as a planning artifact (legacy mode).

## Process

### 1. Gather Context

If given an issue doc, read it. Extract: summary, ACs, scope, technical notes.

Dispatch a codebase investigator to understand current state:
```xml
<invoke name="Agent">
<parameter name="subagent_type">ed3d-research-agents:codebase-investigator</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Investigating codebase for [feature]</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">
Given that we want to [summary from issue], investigate:
- Existing related functionality or patterns
- Relevant file structure and conventions
- Architectural decisions already in place
- Constraints from existing code

Working directory: [repo root]

Do not dispatch or invoke any subagents — investigate directly with your own tools.
</parameter>
</invoke>
```

If external technologies are involved, use `combined-researcher` instead.

If the user hasn't provided enough context, ask for what's missing. Don't ask a long checklist — ask the 1-2 most important questions.

### 2. Confirm Definition of Done

From context gathered, synthesize:
- What gets built (deliverables)
- What success looks like (testable criteria)
- What's explicitly out of scope

Present to user: "Before we explore approaches, here's what I think 'done' means: [DoD]. Correct?"

If user adjusts, incorporate and re-confirm. Don't proceed until confirmed.

### 3. Choose a Slug

The slug becomes the AC prefix (e.g., `cost-ledger.AC1.1`). Suggest 2-3 options:
- If there's a ticket ID, use it: `CG-14-codebuild-infra`
- Otherwise: short, unambiguous kebab-case

Ask user to pick or provide their own.

### 4. Brainstorm Approaches

Propose 2-3 architectural approaches with trade-offs:

```
**Option A: [Name]**
[2-3 sentences: how it works]
Trade-off: [pro] vs [con]

**Option B: [Name]**
[2-3 sentences]
Trade-off: [pro] vs [con]
```

Ask: "Which direction, or should I explore a hybrid?"

If the choice is obvious (one option clearly dominates), say so and ask for confirmation rather than forcing a false choice.

### 5. Write the Design Document

Create `docs/design-plans/YYYY-MM-DD-{slug}.md`:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Design

## Summary
[2-3 sentences]

## Definition of Done
[Confirmed DoD from step 2]

## Acceptance Criteria

### {slug}.AC1: [Criterion Group]
- **{slug}.AC1.1 Success:** [what passing looks like]
- **{slug}.AC1.2 Failure:** [what rejection looks like]

### {slug}.AC2: [Criterion Group]
...

## Architecture
[Chosen approach from step 4, elaborated]

## Contract Impact
[Only when docs/canon/ exists and the design touches contract models:
which registry entries this creates/changes/consumes, and whether the change is
breaking (breaking → needs an ADR). Mirror this into docs/canon/impact/<slug>.md
during planning.]

## Existing Patterns
[What codebase investigation revealed — patterns to follow]

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: [Title]
**Goal:** [one sentence]
**Components:** [files/dirs]
**Done when:** [subset of ACs]

### Phase 2: [Title]
...

(Maximum 8 phases. If more are needed, split into multiple design docs.)

## Glossary
[Key terms, especially domain-specific ones]
```

**AC rules:**
- Generate both success and failure cases for each criterion
- Present ACs to user for validation before committing
- Use the full scoped identifier format

Commit the design doc. **Run from `$WORKTREE_PATH` if provided** so the commit lands on the feature branch:

```bash
cd "${WORKTREE_PATH:-$REPO_ROOT}"
git add docs/design-plans/
git commit -m "docs: design plan for [slug]"
```

### 6. Hand Off

```
Design complete: docs/design-plans/[filename]
Worktree: [WORKTREE_PATH if provided, else "(none — created at /plan time)"]

Next: /jackal-impl-plan docs/design-plans/[filename]
```

No /clear needed. `jackal-impl-plan` reads the `## Worktree` block from the issue doc and reuses the existing worktree.

---

## Guidance Files

Check for `.jackal/design-guidance.md` in the project root. If found, read it before step 2 — it contains project-specific terminology, constraints, and preferences (including standing constraints ingested from Director review memos).

---

## When to Go Backward

- Brainstorming reveals DoD is unclear → re-confirm DoD
- Writing ACs reveals architectural gap → re-brainstorm
- User questions an assumption → investigate more

Don't force linear progression when backtracking gives better results.
