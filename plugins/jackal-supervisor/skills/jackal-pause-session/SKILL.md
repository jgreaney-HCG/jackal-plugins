# Jackal Pause Session

Records a clean checkpoint when you're stopping work mid-issue.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using jackal-pause-session to record a checkpoint for [ISSUE-ID]."

---

## Step 0: Load Project Config

Read the **## Jackal Config** section from the project's CLAUDE.md. Extract:
- `repo_root`, `issue_prefix`, `issue_docs`
- `backend` — `github` or `todo-md` (default: `todo-md`)
- `gh_repo` — `owner/repo` (required when `backend: github`)

---

## When to Use

- Stopping work mid-design, mid-impl-plan, or mid-execution
- Waiting on an external decision before proceeding
- Context-switching to another issue
- Ending the session and not returning immediately

---

## Step 1: Resolve Input

**Accepts any combination of:**
- Issue ID: `PREFIX-XXX`
- Reason for pausing (freeform text)

Examples:
```
/jackal-pause-session                                    # detect from branch, ask reason
/jackal-pause-session PREFIX-35                          # explicit ID, ask reason
/jackal-pause-session PREFIX-35 waiting on infra         # explicit ID + reason
/jackal-pause-session waiting on design approval         # detect ID from branch
```

**Detect issue ID** (if not provided):
```bash
git branch --show-current
```
Extract from branch name (e.g., `feature/ui/PREFIX-46-...` → `PREFIX-46`).

**Find the issue doc:**
```bash
ls $REPO_ROOT/$ISSUE_DOCS/ | grep "PREFIX-XXX"
```

Confirm Status is "In Progress".

---

## Step 2: Determine the Checkpoint

**First: check the live task list before asking the user anything.**

Use TaskList to read the current session's tasks. The ed3d design and implementation skills create tasks for each phase.

**If tasks exist:**
- Completed tasks → phases already done
- `in_progress` task → the phase we're currently in
- Pending tasks → what comes next

**If no tasks exist** — fall back to git evidence:
```bash
git log --oneline -5
ls $REPO_ROOT/$DESIGN_PLANS/ | grep PREFIX-XXX
ls $REPO_ROOT/$IMPL_PLANS/ | grep -i PREFIX-XXX
```

**Only ask the user for what you genuinely can't determine:**
> "I can see [inferred state]. Why are you pausing? Any context I should record?"

If waiting on something external → route to Blocked status.

---

## Step 3: Write the Checkpoint

**Format as a single compact line:**
```
[phase + what's done] — next: [immediate next action] [| note: <optional context>]
```

Examples:
- `Design Phase 3 done — next: /jackal-impl-plan $DESIGN_PLANS/2026-04-05-PREFIX-46.md`
- `Impl Phase 2 complete — next: resume Phase 3 in /execute-implementation-plan`
- `Impl plan exists, execution not started — next: /execute-implementation-plan $IMPL_PLANS/.../`

---

## Step 4: Update the Issue Doc

Edit `$ISSUE_DOCS/PREFIX-XXX-*.md`:

1. `**Status:** In Progress` → `**Status:** Paused` (or `Blocked`)
2. Set `**Last Checkpoint:**` to the checkpoint string
3. If blocked, add to **Dependencies**: `- Blocked by: [what you're waiting for]`

---

## Step 5: Update Backlog State

**If `backend: github`:**

```bash
GH_ISSUE_NUM=$(echo "$ISSUE_ID" | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
NEW_LABEL="status:paused"   # or "status:blocked" if blocked
OLD_LABEL="status:in-progress"

gh issue edit "$GH_ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$GH_REPO" \
  --add-label "$NEW_LABEL" \
  --remove-label "$OLD_LABEL"

gh issue comment "$GH_ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$GH_REPO" --body "$(cat <<EOF
**Paused** — checkpoint recorded

- Status: ${NEW_LABEL#status:}
- Checkpoint: ${CHECKPOINT_STRING}
- Branch: \`${BRANCH}\`
- Worktree: \`${WORKTREE_PATH}\`

To resume: ask the supervisor "resume ${ISSUE_ID}".
EOF
)"
```

**If `backend: todo-md`:**

```bash
sed '/RESOLVED_SECTION_START/q' $REPO_ROOT/TODO.md
```

Move the row from **Active** to the appropriate table:
- Paused → `## Paused` (columns: ID | Title | Branch | Checkpoint | Detail)
- Blocked → `## Blocked` (columns: ID | Title | Blocker | Detail)

The Paused row format:
```
| PREFIX-XXX | [title ≤6 words] | feature/module/PREFIX-XXX-slug | [checkpoint ~50 chars] | [doc]($ISSUE_DOCS/PREFIX-XXX-slug.md) |
```

Update "Last updated" date — set to `Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD`, date only, no commentary.

---

## Step 6: Commit the Checkpoint

```bash
cd $REPO_ROOT
# backend=github: only the issue doc changed
# backend=todo-md: TODO.md also changed
if [ "$BACKEND" = "github" ]; then
  git add $ISSUE_DOCS/PREFIX-XXX-*.md
else
  git add $ISSUE_DOCS/PREFIX-XXX-*.md TODO.md
fi
git commit -m "chore: pause PREFIX-XXX — checkpoint: [brief phrase]"
```

Do NOT push — local checkpoint commit only.

---

## Step 7: Confirm to the User

```
✅ Checkpoint recorded for PREFIX-XXX — [title]

Status: Paused
Checkpoint: [the checkpoint string]

When ready to resume:
  Ask the supervisor: "resume PREFIX-XXX"
  → It will read the checkpoint and give you the exact resume command.

Worktree preserved at: .worktrees/PREFIX-XXX-slug
Branch preserved: feature/module/PREFIX-XXX-slug
```

---

## Edge Cases

**Work was interrupted (no context on current phase):**
Examine git evidence, synthesize a best-effort checkpoint, confirm with user:
```
Based on commits and docs:
- Last commit: [message, N hours ago]
- Design plan: [exists / missing]
- Impl plan: [exists / missing]

Best-guess checkpoint: [inferred state]
Does this look right?
```

**Multiple issues in flight:**
If the user doesn't specify which to pause, list Active ones and ask.
