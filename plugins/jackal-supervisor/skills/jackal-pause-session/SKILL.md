# Jackal Pause Session

Records a clean checkpoint when you're stopping work mid-issue.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using jackal-pause-session to record a checkpoint for [ISSUE-ID]."

---

## Step 0: Load Project Config

Read the **## Jackal Config** section from the project's CLAUDE.md. Extract:
- `repo_root`, `issue_prefix`, `issue_docs`
- `gh_repo` — `owner/repo` (required)
- `label_style` — `slash` or `colon` (default: `slash`) — separator for status labels; examples
  below use `/`, substitute `:` if `colon`

---

## When to Use

- Stopping work mid-design, mid-impl-plan, or mid-execution
- Waiting on an external decision before proceeding
- Context-switching to another issue
- Ending the session and not returning immediately

---

## Step 1: Resolve Input

**Accepts any combination of:**
- Issue ID: `PREFIX-XXX`
- Reason for pausing (freeform text)

Examples:
```
/jackal-pause-session                                    # detect from branch, ask reason
/jackal-pause-session PREFIX-35                          # explicit ID, ask reason
/jackal-pause-session PREFIX-35 waiting on infra         # explicit ID + reason
/jackal-pause-session waiting on design approval         # detect ID from branch
```

**Detect issue ID** (if not provided):
```bash
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
# bare-integer scheme: <type>/<issue#>-slug  (e.g. feat/24-foo → 24)
ISSUE_ID=$(echo "$BRANCH" | grep -oE '(^|/)[0-9]+(-|$)' | grep -oE '[0-9]+' | head -1)
# legacy prefixed scheme fallback: <type>/<module>/PREFIX-46-slug → PREFIX-46
[ -z "$ISSUE_ID" ] && ISSUE_ID=$(echo "$BRANCH" | grep -oE '[A-Z]{2,}-[0-9]+[a-z]?' | head -1)
```

**Find the issue doc:**
```bash
ls $REPO_ROOT/$ISSUE_DOCS/ | grep "PREFIX-XXX"
```

Confirm Status is "In Progress".

---

## Step 2: Determine the Checkpoint

**First: check the live task list before asking the user anything.**

Use TaskList to read the current session's tasks. The jackal design and implementation skills create tasks for each phase.

**If tasks exist:**
- Completed tasks → phases already done
- `in_progress` task → the phase we're currently in
- Pending tasks → what comes next

**If no tasks exist** — fall back to git evidence:
```bash
git log --oneline -5
ls $REPO_ROOT/$DESIGN_PLANS/ | grep PREFIX-XXX
ls $REPO_ROOT/$IMPL_PLANS/ | grep -i PREFIX-XXX
```

**Only ask the user for what you genuinely can't determine:**
> "I can see [inferred state]. Why are you pausing? Any context I should record?"

If waiting on something external → route to Blocked status.

---

## Step 3: Write the Checkpoint

**Format as a single compact line:**
```
[phase + what's done] — next: [immediate next action] [| note: <optional context>]
```

The resume command must be runnable as-is. `/execute` takes `[plan-directory] [working-directory]` — always include the worktree as the second arg, since resuming usually starts from the repo root, not inside the worktree.

**The plan directory must be a real path.** Build it from the project's `impl_plans`
config (e.g. `docs/impl-plans`), NOT a hardcoded `docs/implementation-plans/`. Before
emitting the resume command, confirm the directory actually exists:

```bash
ls "$REPO_ROOT/$WORKTREE_REL/$IMPL_PLANS/" 2>/dev/null   # find the real plan dir name
```

Use the actual dir name you find (format `YYYY-MM-DD-<issue#>-<slug>`), not a guessed one.

Examples (with `impl_plans: docs/impl-plans`):
- `Design Phase 3 done — next: /jackal-impl-plan $DESIGN_PLANS/2026-04-05-46-slug.md`
- `Impl Phase 2 complete — next: /execute <worktree>/docs/impl-plans/2026-04-05-46-slug/ <worktree>` (resumes at Phase 3)
- `Impl plan exists, execution not started — next: /execute <worktree>/docs/impl-plans/2026-04-05-46-slug/ <worktree>`

---

## Step 4: Update the Issue Doc

Edit `$ISSUE_DOCS/PREFIX-XXX-*.md`:

1. `**Status:** In Progress` → `**Status:** Paused` (or `Blocked`)
2. Set `**Last Checkpoint:**` to the checkpoint string
3. If blocked, add to **Dependencies**: `- Blocked by: [what you're waiting for]`

---

## Step 5: Update Backlog State

```bash
GH_ISSUE_NUM=$(echo "$ISSUE_ID" | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
NEW_LABEL="status/paused"   # or "status/blocked" if blocked (use ':' if label_style: colon)
OLD_LABEL="status/in-progress"

gh issue edit "$GH_ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$GH_REPO" \
  --add-label "$NEW_LABEL" \
  --remove-label "$OLD_LABEL"

gh issue comment "$GH_ISSUE_NUM" --repo "$GH_REPO" --body "$(cat <<EOF
**Paused** — checkpoint recorded

- Status: ${NEW_LABEL#status:}
- Checkpoint: ${CHECKPOINT_STRING}
- Branch: \`${BRANCH}\`
- Worktree: \`${WORKTREE_PATH}\`

To resume: ask the supervisor "resume ${ISSUE_ID}".
EOF
)"
```

---

## Step 6: Commit the Checkpoint

```bash
cd $REPO_ROOT
git add $ISSUE_DOCS/PREFIX-XXX-*.md
git commit -m "chore: pause PREFIX-XXX — checkpoint: [brief phrase]"
```

Do NOT push — local checkpoint commit only.

---

## Step 7: Confirm to the User

```
✅ Checkpoint recorded for PREFIX-XXX — [title]

Status: Paused
Checkpoint: [the checkpoint string]

When ready to resume:
  Ask the supervisor: "resume PREFIX-XXX"
  → It will read the checkpoint and give you the exact resume command.

Worktree preserved at: .worktrees/24-slug
Branch preserved: feat/24-slug
```

---

## Edge Cases

**Work was interrupted (no context on current phase):**
Examine git evidence, synthesize a best-effort checkpoint, confirm with user:
```
Based on commits and docs:
- Last commit: [message, N hours ago]
- Design plan: [exists / missing]
- Impl plan: [exists / missing]

Best-guess checkpoint: [inferred state]
Does this look right?
```

**Multiple issues in flight:**
If the user doesn't specify which to pause, list Active ones and ask.
